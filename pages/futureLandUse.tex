\section{Future Land Use}

\noindent \hl{[do more to fully introduce this section]}\\

\noindent Maps on the following pages are the proposed future land use (FLU) maps for Bloomfield's entire zoning jurisdiction. They should guide all land use and development decisions over the next ten years. Should the Bloomfield Planning Commission and the City Council choose to make policy decisions that are not reflected on the FLU map, then the FLU map must be amended to reflect the change in policies.
