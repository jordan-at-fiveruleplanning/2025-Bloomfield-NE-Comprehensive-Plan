\subsection{Business Establishments}

\noindent Over the last five years, the number of business establishments in Knox County has changed very little. \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:bizEstablishments}} shows that the total number of businesses has decreased by just two during this time. All of the business loss is driven by fewer government establishments, while the number of private sector businesses has increased.
